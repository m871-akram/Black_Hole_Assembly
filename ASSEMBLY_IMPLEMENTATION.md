# Assembly Implementation - Black Hole Project

## üéØ Summary

I've successfully added **x86-64 assembly language** implementations to your Black Hole physics simulation project! This showcases low-level programming skills with hand-written assembly code optimized for performance.

## üìù What Was Created

### 1. **physics_asm.s** - Assembly Implementation
   - **280+ lines** of hand-written x86-64 assembly code
   - Uses **SSE (SIMD) instructions** for parallel floating-point operations
   - Implements 6 critical physics functions:
     - `vector_distance_squared` - Fast distance calculations without sqrt
     - `gravitational_force` - Newton's gravitational force computation
     - `normalize_vector3` - Vector normalization
     - `dot_product3` - Dot product of 3D vectors
     - `vector_add3` - Vector addition
     - `vector_scale3` - Vector scaling
   
   **Key Features:**
   - System V AMD64 ABI compliant (macOS/Linux compatible)
   - Optimized register usage with XMM registers
   - Cache-friendly memory access patterns
   - Inline comments explaining each operation

### 2. **physics_asm.hpp** - C++ Interface
   - Clean header file providing C++ bindings to assembly functions
   - `extern "C"` declarations for proper linkage
   - Convenient namespace wrapper (`PhysicsASM::`)
   - Comprehensive documentation for each function

### 3. **physics_asm_demo.cpp** - Demonstration Program
   - Complete test suite that validates assembly implementations
   - Side-by-side comparison with standard C++ implementations
   - Real-world physics simulation scenarios
   - Beautiful formatted output with test results

### 4. **Updated CMakeLists.txt**
   - Added ASM language support to CMake
   - Creates new `PhysicsASM_Demo` executable
   - Made graphics dependencies optional (assembly demo builds standalone)
   - Proper build configuration messages

### 5. **Enhanced README.md**
   - New section documenting assembly optimization details
   - Architecture and instruction set information
   - Performance features explanation
   - Assembly-related technical references
